- only manipulate elements if these exist
- move environment detection to custom js

pocket-kitten:
- when adding KaiOS CSS, also add app theme color
- KaiOS buttons: ?, New cat, Fullscreen
- KaiOS: fullscreen mode (removes tip and image occupies the whole screen and softkey footer becomes transparent)

- four things to detect: OS (KaiOS, etc), browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc), protocol, app framework (Electron, Cordova)

- Use softkeys for beyond KaiOS: Nintendo Switch and other gaming consoles/entertainment stations

- FMWK r3: detect if Chromium-based or Firefox. Sample extension site that displays a "{platform} Addon" menu item
