For ZeroNet/Clearnet adaptive code and easier production (to not need to create the same features for every site) I'm creating FrameworkJS: an simple, powerfull and adaptive web framework, for both ZeroNet and clearnet. Also, FrameworkJS will help turn zites into real apps. FrameworkJS will make easier the creation of a new project: the user simply clicks to create a new project, the zite is clonned and user is redirected to its brand new project. A "open zite's folder" API should be usefull, so this new project can show this button for user easily begin editting files.
